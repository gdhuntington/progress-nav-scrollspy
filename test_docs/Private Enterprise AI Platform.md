# **Summary**
A “Private Enterprise AI Platform” is most commonly referred to in industry as **Private AI**, **Enterprise AI Platforms**, or **Private AI Infrastructure Systems**. These terms are used by major vendors like **HPE**, **IBM**, **Microsoft**, and **AWS**, and companies *are absolutely building these systems today*. HPE’s “Private Cloud AI” is even recognized as a **Leader** in the IDC MarketScape for Private AI Infrastructure Systems, and AI21 defines “Private AI” as the security‑first approach to deploying AI inside an organization’s own data boundaries.

# **1. What Is a “Private Enterprise AI Platform”?**

Based on industry definitions, a Private Enterprise AI Platform is:

### **A fully on‑premise or hybrid, security‑first AI system that allows an organization to develop, deploy, and operate AI models using its own data, without sending that data to public cloud services.**

It typically includes:

- **Private LLMs** (open‑source or licensed models running on local GPU servers)
- **Vector databases** for semantic search
- **Document intelligence pipelines** for ingesting files, SQL data, SharePoint, code, etc.
- **RAG orchestration** (retrieval‑augmented generation)
- **Governance, compliance, and audit controls**
- **Developer tools** for building AI apps at scale

This aligns with the definition of **Private AI** from AI21, which emphasizes protecting sensitive data throughout its lifecycle and enabling scalable AI inside enterprise boundaries.

It also aligns with AWS’s definition of an **Enterprise AI Platform**, which is “an integrated group of technologies that allow organizations to experiment, develop, deploy, and operate AI applications at scale”.

# **2. Is There a Better or More Standard Name?**

There is **no single universal name**, but there *are* widely accepted industry terms:

## **Industry‑Standard Terms**
| Term | Used By | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Private AI** | AI21, HPE, IBM | Emphasizes security-first, on-prem deployment |
| **Enterprise AI Platform** | AWS, Publicis Sapient | Broad term for org‑wide AI infrastructure |
| **Private AI Infrastructure Systems** | IDC, HPE | Formal category in IDC MarketScape reports |
| **Private Cloud AI** | HPE | Turnkey on‑prem AI system co-developed with NVIDIA |
| **Enterprise AI** | BuiltIn, AWS | General term for AI at scale in large organizations |

### **Most accurate and industry-aligned name**
**Private AI Platform**  
or  
**Private Enterprise AI Platform**

Both are used in analyst reports, vendor documentation, and enterprise AI strategy discussions.

# **3. Are Companies Actually Doing This Today?**

**Yes — aggressively.**  
Private AI adoption is accelerating because enterprises want AI benefits *without* exposing sensitive data.

### Evidence:
- AI21 reports that organizations implementing **Private AI** see **2.4× higher productivity** and **3.3× better AI scaling success**.
- HPE’s Private Cloud AI is recognized as a **Leader** in the IDC MarketScape for Private AI Infrastructure Systems.
- IBM is pushing for industry-wide AI standardization and enterprise AI benchmarking.
- AWS and Microsoft both publish formal definitions and tooling for **Enterprise AI Platforms**.

# **4. Which Big Companies Have Built or Deployed These Platforms?**

### **Major Vendors Building Private AI Platforms**
| Company | Offering | Evidence |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **HPE** | *HPE Private Cloud AI* | Recognized as a Leader in IDC’s Private AI Infrastructure Systems report |
| **IBM** | *ITBench* and enterprise AI automation platforms | IBM aims to set industry standards for enterprise AI |
| **Microsoft** | *Microsoft Foundry* and Azure AI infrastructure | Foundry is positioned as a standard for enterprise AI development |
| **AWS** | *Enterprise AI Platform* tooling | AWS defines and supports enterprise AI platforms at scale |
| **Google** | Enterprise AI leadership recognized by Gartner | Named a leader in AI vendor ecosystem |
| **OpenAI (Enterprise Tier)** | Private deployments for large orgs | Recognized by Gartner as a top enterprise AI vendor |

### **Industries Actively Deploying Private AI**
- Finance (due to regulatory constraints)
- Healthcare (HIPAA)
- Government & defense
- Manufacturing
- Energy
- Insurance
- Large enterprises with legacy data sprawl

---

# **5. Why Companies Are Doing This Now**

### Key drivers:
- **Data sovereignty** (no data leaves the organization)
- **Compliance** (SOX, HIPAA, PCI, FedRAMP, etc.)
- **Legacy modernization** (SQL, SharePoint, file shares, codebases)
- **Operational efficiency**
- **AI‑powered search across decades of documents**
- **Risk reduction** (avoid public cloud exposure)

This aligns with AI21’s findings that data silos block AI adoption for 82% of enterprises, and Private AI solves this by respecting enterprise data boundaries.
